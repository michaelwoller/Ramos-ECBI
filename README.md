Analysis.R contains all the analysis included within the paper as well as a few others that were not included. The script also contains the code for visual plots. 

PCIT_Long.csv contains the cleaned data used for the analysis. The data was cleaned by narrowing down the data set to the focal variables of interest (DPICS_P, DPICS_N, ECBI scores as well as weekly indicators for PDI or CDI). The data has been clean of weeks where participants were missing values of either the CDI or PDI sessions.

PCIT_Comparisons.sav is the data set that includes specific values for the mean comparison tests in the paper, such as the number of sessions attended per CDI or PDI, or the value of ECBI at the end/beginning of the CDI sessions.
